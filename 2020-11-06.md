### Integer division is one of the slowest arithmetic operations you can perform on a modern processor

Division and Multiplication can also be done by bit shifting left or right.

```python
# Multiply by bitwise left shift operator (power of 2)
>>> x=2
# multiply by 2 shift binary one step left 00010 => 00100
>>> x << 1 
4
# multiply by 4 00010 => 01000
>>> x << 2 
8
# multiply by 5
# first shift left 2 times, then add another x
# 00010 << 2 => 01000
# 01000 + 00010 => 01010
>>> (x << 2) +x
10

#Divide by bitwise right shift operator (power of 2)
# divide by 2 shift binary right 10000 => 01000
>>> 16 >> 1
8
# divide by 4 10000 => 01000
>>> 16 >> 2 
4
# divide by 8 10000 => 00010
>>> 16 >> 3 
2
```
